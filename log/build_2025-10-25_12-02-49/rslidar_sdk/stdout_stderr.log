  By not providing "Findrs_driver.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "rs_driver", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "rs_driver" with
  any of the following names:

    rs_driverConfig.cmake
    rs_driver-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "rs_driver" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "rs_driver_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "rs_driver" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
